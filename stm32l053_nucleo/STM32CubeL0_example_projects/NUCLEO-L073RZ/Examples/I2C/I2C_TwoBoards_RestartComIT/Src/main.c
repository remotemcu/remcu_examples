  * @brief   This sample code shows how to use STM32L0xx I2C HAL API to transmit
  *          and receive a data buffer with a communication process based on
  *          IT transfer and with a repeated start condition between the transmit
  *          and receive process.. 
  *          The communication is done using 2 Boards.
