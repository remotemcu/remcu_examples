@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three 
complementary TIM1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
feature and to lock the desired parameters.

TIM1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock used is SystemCoreClock.
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for Low-density, Medium-density, High-density
and Connectivity line devices. For Low-Density Value line, Medium-Density and
High-Density Value line devices, SystemCoreClock is set to 24 MHz.

The objective is to generate PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1

The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

A dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock is inserted between the different 
complementary signals, and the Lock level 1 is selected.
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density 
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210C-EVAL (Connectivity line), 
    STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins(TIM1 full remapped pins) to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PE.09)
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PE.08)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PE.11)  
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PE.10)
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PE.13)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PE.12)  
    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PE.15) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V. 

  - STM3210E-EVAL, STM3210B-EVAL, STM32100B-EVAL and STM32100E-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)  
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)

    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.
