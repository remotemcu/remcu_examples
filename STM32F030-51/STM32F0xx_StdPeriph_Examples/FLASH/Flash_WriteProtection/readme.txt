@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32F0xx embedded FLASH.

- Enable Write protection: 
   To enable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_ENABLE"
   in main.c file.  
   To protect a set of pages, the user has to call the function FLASH_EnableWriteProtection.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be protected.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
 
- Disable Write protection:
   To disable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE"
   in main.c file.
   To disable the write protection of the STM32F0xx Flash, an erase of the Option 
   Bytes is necessary. This operation is done by the function FLASH_EraseOptionBytes.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.

If the desired pages are not write protected, an erase and a write operation are
performed.

      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F0xx_Clock_Configuration_VX.Y.Z.xls" 
      provided with the AN4055 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
