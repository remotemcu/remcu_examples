@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to program the STM32F0xx FLASH.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase page feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of pages to be used. Then all these pages will be erased one by one by
calling FLASH_ErasePage function. 

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed by 
using the FLASH_ProgramWord function. The written data is then checked and the
result of the programming operation is stored into the MemoryProgramStatus variable.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F0xx_Clock_Configuration_VX.Y.Z.xls" 
      provided with the AN4055 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
