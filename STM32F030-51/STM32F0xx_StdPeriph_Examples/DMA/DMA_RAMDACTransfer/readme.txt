@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer data 
buffer from RAM memory to DAC.

DMA1 channel3 is configured to transfer continuously, word by word, a Half-word 
buffer to the DAC register DAC_DHR12R. The DAC channel conversion is configured 
to be triggered by TIM2 TRGO triggers and without noise/triangle wave generation.
12bit right data alignment is selected since we choose to access DAC_DHR12R register.

You can monitor the DAC output waveform on PA.04 pin.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect DAC_OUT pin PA.04 to an oscilloscope to visualize the DAC output waveform 
     
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect DAC_OUT pin PA.04 to an oscilloscope to visualize the DAC output waveform 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select the appropriate workspace
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
