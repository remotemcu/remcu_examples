@par Example Description 

This example describes how to measure VBAT voltage using ADC1 regular channel 18.
The measured value corresponds to VBAT/2; as the VBAT voltage could be higher
than VDDA, to ensure the correct operation of the ADC, the VBAT pin is internally
connected to a bridge divider by 2.

User can display the VBAT voltage on the EVAL Board LCD

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that jumper JP12 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Make sure that jumper JP11 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin

     
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval_lcd.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
      - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
