@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic communication, using interrupts, between two HDMI-CEC
devices and an spy CEC device which receives messages addressed to different destination. 
The first and second CEC devices send a command to the other CEC device. The spy
device can receive the data when Listen mode option is enabled.
The data transfer is managed using CEC_IRQHandler in stm32f0xx_it.c file.

The example illustrates the use of the CEC communication between three devices 
(3 x STM320518/STM32072B-EVAL boards). A device can send a frame to the other
device by pressing the Joystick button on the EVAL board and the spy device 
receives this message. 

- Hardware Description
  To use this example, you need to load it on three STM320518/STM32072B-EVAL boards (let's call 
  them Device_1, Device_2 and Device_3) then connect these boards through CEC lines
  (PB10 for STM320518-EVAL and PB08 for STM32072B-EVAL  or HDMI connectors) and GND.
  In the firmware example, uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file to use
  the CEC peripheral as Device_1 or as Device_2 or as Device_3.

- Software Description
  At each joystick buttons press:
    - The CEC device sends the specific command (Volume Up, Volume Down, OSD Name or
      CEC Version) to the specific device and the spy device receive the message
      command.

    - The sender device can send a frame to the other device by pressing the JoyStick 
      button on the EVAL board. Sending status is signaled by lightening and though 
      as follow:
         - If Joystick RIGHT, LEFT, Up or Down is pressed and the data transmission is 
           succeeded ==> Green Led(LD1) is ON.
         - If Joystick RIGHT, LEFT, Up or Down is pressed and the data transmission is 
           failed ==> Red Led(LD3) is ON.    
 
    - The Receiver device receive data, Received data is signaled by LED lightening and 
      though as follow:
         - OSD Name   : Joystick RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD1, LD2 ON and LD3,LD4 OFF, 
         - CEC Version: Joystick LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD3, LD4 ON and LD1,LD2 OFF,
         - Volume Up  : Joystick UP and data correctly received    ==> LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 are ON,
         - Volume Down: Joystick DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 are OFF.
         - If an error occurs during reception ==> Only LD3(Red LED) is ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect the boards by using one of the two following alternatives:
        - A HDMI Cables between all boards HDMI-CEC connectors (CN3 or CN4) on 
          STM320518-EVAL . 
        - Use simple wires between all devices CEC Lines (PB.10), in this case don't 
          forget to connect all boards grounds together.
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Connect the boards by using one of the two following alternatives:
        - A HDMI Cables between all boards HDMI-CEC connectors (CN3 or CN5) on 
          STM32072B-EVAL . 
        - Use simple wires between all devices CEC Lines (PB.08), in this case don't 
          forget to connect all boards grounds together.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
