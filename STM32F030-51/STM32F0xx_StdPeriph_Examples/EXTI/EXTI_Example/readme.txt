@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure external interrupt lines.
In this example, 4 EXTI lines (EXTI0, EXTI2, EXTI3 and EXTI13) when using the STM32072B-EVAL
or 4EXTI lines (EXTI0, EXTI8, EXTI9, EXTI13) when using the STM320518-EVAL are configured to
generate an interrupt on each falling edge. In the interrupt routine a led connected to a 
specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example
    - EXTI0  is mapped to PA0
    - EXTI13 is mapped to PC13
    If STM32F051R8T6 device is used
       - EXTI3  is mapped to PE3
       - EXTI2  is mapped to PE2 
    If STM32F072VBT6 device is used
       - EXTI8  is mapped to PC8
       - EXTI9  is mapped to PC9 


After EXTI configuration, a software interrupt is generated on the EXTI8 and LED1 toggles.
After that,
  when falling edge is detected on EXTI0, LED2 toggles
  when falling edge is detected on EXTI13, LED4 toggles
  If STM32F051R8T6 device is used
      when falling edge is detected on EXTI3, LED1 toggles
      when falling edge is detected on EXTI2, LED3 toggles
  If STM32F072VBT6 device is used
      when falling edge is detected on EXTI8, LED1 toggles
      when falling edge is detected on EXTI9, LED3 toggles


If STM320518-EVAL or STM32072B-EVAL is used,
  when Joystick Sel push-button is pressed, LED2 toggles
  when Joystick Right push-button is pressed, LED1 toggles
  when Joystick Left push-button is pressed, LED3 toggles
  when Tamper push-button is pressed, LED4 toggles

In this example, EXTI0_Config() function can be substituted by 
STM_EVAL_PBInit(BUTTON_SEL, Mode_EXTI) provided in the STM320518-EVAL driver.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use Joystick Right, Left and Sel push-button
     - USe Tamper push-button
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Use Joystick Right, Left and Sel push-button
     - USe Tamper push-button
