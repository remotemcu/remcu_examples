@par Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32F0xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 2 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (2 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 2 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
   LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the 
  LCD, it corresponds to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using Joystick LEFT, RIGHT and Tamper buttons:
    - press Joystick LEFT  button to start counter.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to save trials in the backup registers (max 5 actions).
    - press and hold Tamper button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick LEFT and RIGHT button
    - Use Tamper button
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Joystick LEFT and RIGHT button
    - Use Tamper button

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
      - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval.c
      - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval_lcd.c 
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
      - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM32072B_EVAL/stm32072b_eval.c
      - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm32072b_eval_lcd.c   
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
