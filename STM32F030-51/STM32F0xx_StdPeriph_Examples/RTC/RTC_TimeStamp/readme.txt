@par Example Description 

 This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral and 
the Time Stamp feature.

One of the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The program behaves as follow:

1. At startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:   
    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      date and timestamp (time and date) are displayed.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin : 
      the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration is not lost.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin : 
      the BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost.

4. It configures the RTC TimeStamp pin to be falling edge and enables the
TimeStamp detection.

5. Applying a low level on the TimeStamp pin (PC.13) by pressing TAMPER push button,
the calendar is saved in the time-stamp registers thanks to the timestamp event detection.
   
The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock, display the current 
time and timestamp registers contents:
 - Pressing TAMPER push button, saves the current time and date in RTC TSTR
   and TSDR registers and  displays the current RTC Calendar (Time and date) and
   RTC TimeStamp Calendar (Time and date). LED2 turns ON.
 - Pressing SEL push button, clears the TimeStamp Calendar. LED1 turns ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use SEL push button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use SEL push button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).

       
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
