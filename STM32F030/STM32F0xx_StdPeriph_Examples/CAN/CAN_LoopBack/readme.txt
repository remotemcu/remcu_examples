@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 125 Kbps. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbps. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.
In polling mode, if communication succeeded LED1 turned ON otherwise LED3 is ON.
In Interrupt mode, if communication succeeded LED4 turned ON otherwise LED2 is ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F072 Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32072B-EVAL including
    STM32F072VBT6 device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PD.08, PD.09, PD.10
      and PD.11 pins

 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
