@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode using FIFO0 and FIFO1. This application example shows 
how to manage the both CAN FIFO as a single FIFO composed by 6 mail boxes.

The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - By Pressing on TAMPER Button : 6 messages are sent to the N eval boards 
    connected to the bus and the received messages are displayed on the LCD
    each time 6 messages are sent.
    
@note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
@note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing TAMPER button)
      or receiver.

The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
    - ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
    - RTR = Data
    - DLC = 1 byte
    - Data: Led number that should be turned ON

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072 Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32072B-EVAL including
    STM32F072VBT6 device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use TAMPER Push Button connected to PC.13
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN6)
    - Jumper JP4 must be fitted in 1-2 position
    - Jumper JP3 must be fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
