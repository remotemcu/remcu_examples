@par Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the RTC peripheral.
As an application example, it demonstrates how to setup the RTC peripheral, in 
terms of prescaler and interrupts, to be used to keep time and to generate 
alarm interrupt. 

One of the following clock source can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c): 
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin. 
A key value is written in backup data register 0 to indicate if the RTC is already
configured

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and the user is asked to set the time and alarm (entered on 
      HyperTerminal).
      LED2 is truned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.

    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and Alarm A are displayed on HyperTerminal.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

4. When an RTC Alarm A event occurs the RTC Alarm interrupt is generated and the
   LED1 is toggled.
   
The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock and display the current time:
 - When Joystcick SEL button is pressed, a menu is displayed to configure the RTC Time 
   and Alarm A registers.
 - When TAMPER button is pressed, the current time is displayed.
 - When Joystcick UP button is pressed, the current alarm A is displayed.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use TAMPER and Joystcick UP/SEL push buttons
    - Make sure that jumper JP12 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN7 (USART1) and PC serial port to display data on the HyperTerminal.
  
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use TAMPER and Joystcick UP/SEL push buttons
    - Make sure that jumper JP11 is in position 2-3 to connect the 3V battery to VBAT pin
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN7 (USART2) and PC serial port to display data on the HyperTerminal.

    - Hyperterminal configuration:
      - Word Length = 8 Bits
      - One Stop Bit
      - No parity
      - BaudRate = 115200 baud
      - flow control: None
