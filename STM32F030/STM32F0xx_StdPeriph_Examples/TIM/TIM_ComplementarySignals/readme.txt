@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate three 
complementary TIM1 signals, to insert a defined dead time value, to use the break 
feature and to lock the desired parameters.

TIM1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the 
TIM1 counter clock used is SystemCoreClock (48MHz).

The objective is to generate PWM signal at 17.57 KHz:
  - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 17570) - 1

The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description: 
The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100

A dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock is inserted between the different 
complementary signals, and the Lock level 1 is selected.
The break Polarity is used at High level.

The TIM1 waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F0Discovery and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F0Discovery board Set-up
      - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
         - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
         - TIM1_CH1N pin (PA.07)  
         - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
         - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.00)  
         - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
         - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.01)
      - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
        break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
      - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
          - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
          - TIM1_CH1N pin (PA.07)  
          - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
          - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.00)  
          - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)  
          - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.01)
      - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
        break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.
