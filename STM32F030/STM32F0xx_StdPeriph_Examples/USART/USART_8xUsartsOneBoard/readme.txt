@par Example Description 

This example provides a small application in which 8xUsarts are used for a circular 
communication using interrupts and USART firmware library.

First, the USARTy sends aTxBuffer to USARTy+1. The USARTy+1 receives data and
stores it into aRxBuffer[y].
Then, the received data is then compared with the sent one. 
Then, USARTy+1 sends the received message to the next USARTy+2.
At the end, the last one USART8 sends the data to the first One USART1.
It can validate the correctness of the USART1_TX sent data and USART1_RX received data.
These operations can be repeated infinitely.

You can see the received data stored in aRxBuffer[] variable using your toolchain debugger.

The 8xUSARTs are configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - No parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32091C-EVAL including 
    respectively STM32F091VCT6 devices and can be easily tailored to any other 
    supported device and development board
    
  - STM32091C-EVAL Set-up
    - Put jumper JP1 in position 2-3
    - Put jumpers in CN1 to connect:
      - USART1 Tx to USART2 Rx in position 1-2, or connect PA9 to PD6
      - USART2 Tx to USART3 Rx in position 3-4, or connect PD5 to PD9
      - USART3 Tx to USART4 Rx in position 5-6, or connect PD8 to PC11
      - USART4 Tx to USART5 Rx in position 7-8, or connect PC10 to PB4
      - USART5 Tx to USART6 Rx in position 9-10, or connect PB3 to PF10
      - USART6 Tx to USART7 Rx in position 11-12, or connect PF9 to PF3
      - USART7 Tx to USART8 Rx in position 13-14, or connect PF2 to PC9
      - USART8 Tx to USART1 Rx in position 15-16, or connect PC8 to PA10

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
