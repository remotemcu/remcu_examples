@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously  
an ADC channel.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel11 and ADC channel10 
respectively for the STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices. 
The analog watchdog is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel11 or channel10 converted value exceeds programmed analog 
watchdog high threshold (value 3102) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold 
(value 1861) an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED4 
is toggled. The LED will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which 
means that the converted value of regular ADC channel11 or channel10 is outside 
the range limited by high and low analog watchdog thresholds.

@note ADC channel11 for STM32F051R8T6 device and channel10 for STM32F072VBT6 are
      connected to a potentiometer (RV3) which can deliver a voltage between 0V 
      and 3.3V.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
