@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC1 to memory.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel11 if the used device 
is STM32F051R8T6 and channel10 if the used one is STM32F072VBT6. In addition 
the ADC1 converts continuously Voltage reference, Temperature sensor 
and Battery charge.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC1 DR register to the RegularConvData_Tab[4] table.
User can vary the ADC1 channel11 or channel10 voltage using the EVAL Board potentiometer RV3.
The 4 converted voltages are displayed on the EVAL Board LCD.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3


@par How to use it ?

   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval_lcd.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
