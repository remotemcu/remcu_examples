@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral with 
Auto-delayed conversion mode and Auto-poweroff modes.

The ADC is triggered by TIM3_TRGO which is connected to TIM3_Update Event.
Each time the ADC is triggered, it converts the RV3 voltage (which corresponds to
ADC channel11 and ADC channel10 respectively in STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices), 
and then the ADC enters in delay mode (no Overrun detect) until the ADC data register 
has been read by pressing KEY button or TAMPER button respectively for STM32F051R8T6 
and STM32F072VBT6 devices.

The Auto delay mode and the Auto power off mode activation can be done by uncommenting
the "#define ADC_LOWPOWER " in the main.c file.
If "#define ADC_LOWPOWER" is commented, an overrun interrupt is generated and
LED1 is toggled. Otherwise, LED1 remains OFF.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     - Use key button
     
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV3
     - Use tamper button


@par How to use it ?
