@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the WakeUp from STOP feature of I2C device using 
the CPAL library. This example requires two boards, one configured in master mode
and another one configured in slave mode.

The I2C of the slave board is configured as slave device which enters in STOP mode
after activating the WakeUp from stop ability. 

The master board is used to WakeUp the slave board from STOP. By pushing the 
Joystick SEL Button of the master board, the I2C device initialize a communication
by sending a Start condition followed by the address of slave device. 

The slave device is woken Up from STOP if it recognizes its own address. 
The received data is checked and the result is displayed on LCD. 

This procedure is repeated infinitely.

The main.h file contains defines(I2C_MASTER, I2C_SLAVE) that select the type of 
the board(master or slave).

Note: Before entering STOP The I2C clock source must be set to HSI.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use two boards should be connected as follow after loading the example:
       - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB6) to I2C1 SCL pin (PB6)
       - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB7) to I2C1 SDA pin (PB7)
       - Connect Gnd pins of two boards.
       
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up
    - Use two boards should be connected as follow after loading the example:
       - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB6) to I2C1 SCL pin (PB6)
       - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB7) to I2C1 SDA pin (PB7)
       - Connect Gnd pins of two boards.

    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Libraries/STM32F0xx_CPAL_Driver/stm32f0xx_i2c_cpal.c
       - Libraries/STM32F0xx_CPAL_Driver/stm32f0xx_i2c_cpal_hal.c
       - stm32f0xx_i2c_cpal_usercallback.c
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval.c
       - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM320518_EVAL/stm320518_eval_lcd.c  
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Libraries/STM32F0xx_CPAL_Driver/stm32f0xx_i2c_cpal.c
       - Libraries/STM32F0xx_CPAL_Driver/stm32f0xx_i2c_cpal_hal.c
