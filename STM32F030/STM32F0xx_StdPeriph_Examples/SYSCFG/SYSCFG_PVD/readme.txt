@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector.

In this example:
  - TIM1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on pin PA.08.
  - PVD threshold is configured to level 5.
   
While Vdd is higher than the PVD threshold (~2.68 V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.08.
While Vdd is lower than the PVD threshold (~2.58 V), PA8 is in low level.

@note   Refer to the electrical characteristics of your device datasheet for more
        details about the voltage threshold corresponding to each PVD detection level.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use RV2 Potentiometer to adjust Vdd.
    - Make sure that jumper JP9 is in position(VDD_ADJ).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display the waveform.
    
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use RV2 Potentiometer to adjust Vdd.
    - Make sure that jumper JP13 is in position(VDD_ADJ).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display the waveform.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
