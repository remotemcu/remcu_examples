@par Example Description 

This example shows how to:
  - Configure the PLL (clocked by HSE) as System clock source
  - Use the Clock Security System (CSS) feature to detect HSE failure
  - Output the System clock on MCO pin

For debug purposes, the RCC_GetClocksFreq() function is used to retrieve the current
status and frequencies of different on-chip clocks.
You can see the RCC_ClockFreq structure content, which holds the frequencies of different
on-chip clocks, using your toolchain debugger.

This example also handles the High Speed External clock (HSE) failure detection
(known as Clock Security System, CSS): when the HSE clock disappears (broken or 
disconnected external Quartz), HSE and PLL are disabled (but no change to PLL 
configuration), HSI is selected as a system clock source and an interrupt (NMI) 
is generated. 
In the NMI ISR, the HSE and HSE ready interrupt are enabled. Once the HSE clock 
recovers, the HSERDY interrupt is generated and, in the RCC ISR routine, the system
clock is reconfigured to its previous state (before HSE clock failure). 
You can monitor the system clock on MCO pin (PA.8).
Two LEDs are toggled with a timing defined by the Delay function.

@note On the STM32072B-EVAL or the STM320518-EVAL boards, to generate the HSE failure you can 
      remove the HSE quartz from the socket.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL and
    STM32072B-EVAL including respectively STM32F051R8T6 and STM32F072VBT6 devices
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
     - To generate the HSE failure you can remove the HSE quartz from the socket. 
  - STM32072B-EVAL Set-up  
     - To generate the HSE failure you can remove the HSE quartz from the socket.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - If the used device is STM32F051R8T6 choose STM32F051 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM320518_EVAL\stm320518_eval.c
 - If the used device is STM32F072VBT6 choose STM32F072 project
    - Add the following files to the project source list
       - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32072B_EVAL\stm32072b_eval.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
