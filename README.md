The [**REMCU Lib**](https://remotemcu.com/) is a cross-platform library designed for remote access to internal peripherals of various MCU and SoC as if these peripherals were a part of your computer.
The library gives access a user space program to all peripherals of the remote chip  through the same API as peripheral drivers from Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by semiconductor chip vendors or third parties for MCU firmware development.
Thereby a developer doesn’t need to learn new tools but can just reuse his firmware code and examples of the SDK in his code designed for personal or embedded computers.
Firmware and protocol communication development are not required, because the [**REMCU Lib**](https://remotemcu.com/) translates itself the local API function call on computer to the call of the same function of peripheral driver on the remote chip.

Let's have a look at the video below and see what opportunities and applications it provides.
